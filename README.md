# Simple Bigger Backpack

I created the **Simple Bigger Backpack** because there was no similar [ModShardLauncher](https://github.com/ModShardTeam/ModShardLauncher)-based Mod on the [NEXUS MODS](https://www.nexusmods.com/stoneshard) website. I was inspired by the idea in the [Simple StoneShard Modding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_kpp-MW0WHNGEtKZJ71__aZ9S8Bq9mo1CY_nF42aVU/edit#) article and created this Mod, which is really easy to use with other ModShardLauncher-based Mods.

## Features

- The backpack only takes up 2x3 space in your inventory (the same to cloaks).
- The backpack has 7x5 storage space.
- The merchant of Osbrook is now selling a backpack in a new game.
