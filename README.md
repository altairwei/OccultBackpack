# Occult Backpack

This is a **Stoneshard** mod, offering two types of backpacks, two quests to make them, and a series of related character dialogues. The **Tailor's Backpack** is larger in capacity and takes up less space than a traditional backpack, while the **Occult Backpack** is directly linked to the Caravan Storage. So opening the backpack is equivalent to opening the Caravan Storage.

**Simple Bigger Backpack** is now maintained in the `SimpleBiggerBackpack` branch.

## Features

- The Tailor's Backpack has 7x6 storage space, and only takes up 2x3 space in your inventory (the same to cloaks).
- The Occult Backpack is directly linked to the Caravan Storage, so opening the Occult Backpack is equivalent to opening the Caravan Storage.
- The quest to create the Tailor's Backpack can be started by talking to the Tailor of Osbrook.
- Talk to the Tailor of Osbrook to get a clue to start the Occult Backpack quest (equip your backpack and show it to the tailor).
